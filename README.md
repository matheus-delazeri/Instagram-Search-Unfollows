# How to use?
Firstly, download the .ZIP file and extract it. After that, open the file InstaSearchUnfollows and fill the required fields:
- Username (1ยบ): the login's username of an Instagram's account.
- Password: the password for the same Instagram's account. 
The script must be logged to access the followers section
- Username (2ยบ): this will be the user that the script will search into. 
Notice that you can login as one account and check the unfollowers of another one.
- Select your browser: select the browser you wish the script runs on.
Now just let the script running until it finishes.

Obs.: in the first time, the script will say that no one unfollowed that account. But after this, whenever you run it, the users that unfollowed the account in this mean time will be displayed.
